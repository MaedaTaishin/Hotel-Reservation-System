This is an collaborative software development project, where we had to design and make a Hotel Reservation System Software. 
Our group constructed Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams to visualize the essence of requirements and software designs using the software called Astah.
Using Astah, we created Domain Analysis, Requirement Analysis, Use Case Diagrams, Activity Diagrams, System Analysis, Communication Diagrams, Class Diagrams, Architectural Design, Package Diagram, Modification and Maintenance in order for us to strategically design the system structures and functions.
We modified the code format that is given in the class using Java programming language to suits our system requirements.
During the process of development we collaborated with team members applying the concept of Sprint Backlog and Kanban board.
